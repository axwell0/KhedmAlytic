        "": " The excavation, identification and reburial of individuals killed and “disappeared” during the recent conflict and under the previous regime is one of the most urgent challenges facing the Libyan state. Addressing the file of missing persons, recovering the truth about the fate of the disappeared through a fair, transparent and scientific truth-seeking process, will deeply contribute to national reconciliation and form a cornerstone of any transitional justice process in Libya. Grievances related to missing persons are also at the heart of local dialogues and reconciliation efforts in various areas. In that context, UNDP and UNSMIL HRS designed a project to address the issue of missing persons in Libya by achieving the two main expected impacts : 1) Victims and their families are better equipped to engage in national and international transitional justice initiatives, and to seek justice and security services, and 2) Security and justice sector actors are better equipped to make security and justice institutions more responsive, accountable, and better able to prevent gross human rights violations, in particular enforced disappearances. To achieve these goals, UNSMIL HRS and the UNDP Strengthening the Rule of Law and Justice in Libya Project (Project Team) will build and expand upon their experience in human rights violations monitoring, providing technical assistance to justice and security institutions, and connecting CSOs and victims’ associations from all three regions of Libya, to address the deep, societal effects of prolonged enforced disappearances on families and communities, and design community-led initiatives laying the groundwork for memorialization, truth-telling, and healing for families of victim including through developing one-stop centres for victims and families of missing persons searching for their loved ones, while also empowering these stakeholders to actively and safely advocate for truth and accountability at the national and international levels. In this context, UNDP is seeking to recruit a Transitional Justice Specialist, working directly within UNSMIL Human Rights Service and under the Chief of HRS, to co-lead project implementation together with UNDP, Libyan national partners, as well as with relevant civil society organizations, and in close coordination with other relevant UN organizations implementing complementary interventions.",

The position holder is also expected to assist in the interface between UNSMIL, UNDP and its implementing partners in the targeted regions, most notably justice, human rights and security institutions. The Specialist would also be required to support the conduct of the requisite analytical, political and legal situational assessment to inform program design and understand trends and patterns that impact on the project. He/she provides policy and technical advisory services to regional government counterparts as well as UNDP. The TJ Specialist is expected to work independently, with minimal supervision but in close collaboration with the project Team in Libya, and to actively engage with government and civil society partners and other actors. The successful candidate will have the following specific responsibilities:",

        "Mission and objectives": " The United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) is the UN’s capital investment agency for the world’s 46 least developed countries. With its capital mandate and instruments, UNCDF offers “last mile” finance models that unlock public and private resources, especially at the domestic level, to reduce poverty and support local economic development. UNCDF’s financing models work through two channels: financial inclusion that expands the opportunities for individuals, households, and small businesses to participate in the local economy, providing them with the tools they need to climb out of poverty and manage their financial lives; and by showing how localized investments — through fiscal decentralization, innovative municipal finance, and structured project finance — can drive public and private funding that underpins local economic expansion and sustainable development. By strengthening how finance works for poor people at the household, small enterprise, and local infrastructure levels, UNCDF contributes to SDG 1 on eradicating poverty and SDG 17 on the means of implementation. By identifying those market segments where innovative financing models can have transformational impact in helping to reach the last mile and address exclusion and inequalities of access, UNCDF contributes to a number of different SDGs. The Local Climate Adaptive Living (LoCAL) facility of the UNCDF was designed and launched in 2011 with the aim of promoting climate change-resilient communities and local economies by establishing a standard and internationally recognized country-based mechanism to channel climate finance to local government authorities (LGAs) in LDCs and to increase local resilience, thereby contributing to the achievement of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly the specific goals of poverty eradication (SDG1) and climate action (SDG13). LoCAL increases awareness and capacities to respond to climate change at the local level, integrates climate change adaptation into local governments' planning and budgeting systems, in a participatory and gender-sensitive manner, and increases the amount of finance available to local governments for climate change adaptation. LoCAL focuses on the delivery of four outputs that will directly contribute to increasing local governments’ access to climate finance and building resilience to climate change: • Output 1 – Awareness and capacities to respond to climate change adaptation at the local level are increased; • Output 2 – Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) is mainstreamed into government’s planning and budgeting systems and investments are implemented in line with the Performance-Based Climate Resilience Grants (PBCRG) mechanism; • Output 3 – The PBCRG system is effectively and sustainably established in participating countries and leads to an increased amount of CCA finance available to local government and local economy; • Output 4 – The role of local authorities and of the PBCRGs in addressing climate change are increasingly recognized at international level, through outreach, learning and quality assurance.",
        "Context": " LoCAL combines performance-based climate resilience grants (PBCRGs) with technical and capacity-building support. PBCRGs ensure programming and verification of climate change expenditures at the local level and offer strong incentives for general performance improvements targeting areas of importance for enhanced resilience. The PBCRG can be seen as an earmarked cross-sectoral grant with conditions attached to the use of its funding for climate change adaptation beyond business as usual. Combined with regular grant allocations, PBCRGs enable 100 per cent of the investments in climate-sensitive sectors to become climate resilient over time. The PBCRGs consist of a financial top-up to cover the additional costs of making investments climate resilient and/or of additional investments for climate change adaptation. These grants complement regular allocations made by the central level to local governments through the respective intergovernmental fiscal transfer system. They include a set of minimum conditions, performance measures and a menu of eligible investments. The Programme operates in three distinct phases:  Phase I: Piloting, consists of an initial scoping analysis, followed by testing in two to four local governments.  Phase II: Consolidating, takes place in 5–10 local governments in a country. It involves collecting lessons and demonstrating the mechanism’s effectiveness at a larger scale.  Phase III: Scaling-up, is full national roll-out of LoCAL based on the results of the previous phases and lessons learned. LoCAL is gradually extended to all local governments, with domestic or international climate finance, and becomes the national system for channeling adaptation finance to the local level. LoCAL in Mediterranean countries The Mediterranean region has been identified as a climate change hotspot, warming some 20% faster than the global average and causing a wide range of negative impacts on the environment, the availability of food and water, human health and security. In urban areas, climate change impacts are aggravated compounded, given the by high population density. In the Mediterranean, in 2018, 60% of people already lived in urban areas, and continued urbanization trends are expected to further exacerbate the climate crisis and put further pressure on natural resources and the environment UNCDF has been selected as implementing partner by the European Union (DG NEAR) to seek to alleviate key bottlenecks to finance urban and local priorities as identified in countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions and other climate policies to truly localize climate actions. within the Programme “Advancing Climate Adaptation in the Southern Mediterranean (ACA-MED)”. UNCDF will implement the second component of the programme ACA-MED: “Reinforcing the capacities of local authorities and increasing climate finance for adaptation at the local level”.
